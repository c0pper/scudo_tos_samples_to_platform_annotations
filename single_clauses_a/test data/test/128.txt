Any claim relating to these Terms that is not resolved through our informal process, or as set forth below, will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the ‚ÄúArbitrator‚Äù) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum.
