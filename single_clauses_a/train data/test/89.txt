You and Shazam agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, New York, NY or any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Shazam will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Shazam will not seek its attorneys‚Äô fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. Either you or Shazam may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York, NY or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Shazam agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of New York County, NY . Both you and Shazam consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.back to top ‚ÜëCOOKIE POLICYShazam Entertainment Limited (‚ÄúShazam‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äùour‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) is committed to being transparent about the technologies it uses.
